        <h1>Education</h1>
        <br>
        This section conatains summary of what I did and what I learned in
        some of my favorite classes. My education also includes several math classes,
        physics, and some electrical engineering classes, but my favorite classes involve
        low level programming and microprocessors.
        <div class="break"></div>

        <h2 id="SYSPROG">Systems Programming</h2>
          This class had many labs and projects that were programmed in C.
          Prior to this class, programming was not coming easy to me, but this 
          is where it all started to click for me.  In this class, I learned
          memory manipulation, and pointer math. These skills have vastly helped
          me program in assembly, because memory manipulation is so important.
          Unfortunately I am unable to 
          share some of the code that was produced as a part of this class, due to UB's
          strict academic violation policy, but I can share what was done.
          <br>
          <br>
          One of the major projects that was included in this class was one where 
          I had to develop an implementaion of the C functions: malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), and 
          free(). In order to create this implementation, sbrk() was used inorder to create a chunk
          of memory that was accessible.  I then used a linked list that stored valid memory
          addresses that were 4 bytes apart.  malloc, pulled the required amount of memory off 
          the linked list, and free put memory back onto the linked list.  While this, is 
          an over simplified version of what complexities were involved in this program, 
          this project boosted my confidence significantly as a developer. 
          <div class="break"></div>

        <h2 id="COMPORG">Computer Organization</h2>
          This class involved my introduction to assembly, but specifically MIPS assembly
          was used.  The main part of this class, was to learn how a computer actually
          works.  I learned how languages like C are compiled into assembly and how that
          assembly goes through the assembly to be converted to machine code.
          <br>
          <br>
          The major project that this class had was to take a list of x,y coordinates 
          and sort the coordinates by euclidean distance in MIPS assembly.  The sort 
          algorithm that I used was essentially selection sort.  One thing that I enjoyed
          in this project that was not a requirement was finding a way to print that data
          to the terminal screen in an organized manner.  obviously testing is not easy 
          when it comes to programming in assembly and this subroutine to print the data
          vastly helped with my success on this project.  The code for this project can be
          seen here: 
          <a class="link" href="https://github.com/jesseboth/Least-Euclidean-Distance/tree/master/Project/">Least Euclidean Distance</a>
          <div class="break"></div>

        <h2 id="MICROP">Microprocessors</h2>
          As of Spring '21 I am currently enrolled in this class. I have learned a lot so far.
          This course utilizes the Tiva C processor model EK-TM4C123GXL. All the programming
          in this class has been done in assembly.  I have learned how to utilize gpio from the 
          microprocessor as well as UART control. 

          At the moment of writing this, I am developing a program to similate the game "Flow Free".
          This project is using everything that I have learned in the class thus far. I am using ANSI
          escape sequences to provide color to the game and several custom made data structures in order
          to track positions of the links and cursor movement.
          <div class="break"></div>

        <h2 id="MATH">Math/Physics</h2>
        Throughout my college career I was required to take several math and physics courses.
        The courses include:
        <br>
         - Calculus I, II, III
        <br>
         - Discrete Math
        <br>
         - Probability and Statistics
        <br>
         - Differential Equations
        <br>
         - Linear Algebra
        <br>
         - Physics I, II

        <h1>Projects</h1>
        I have worked on many different projects, but the ones
        I tend to stick with are the ones that have a practical purpose.
        I find it boring to work on a project that has no practical use, and
        find that I become more invested if the project has a real purpose.
        <div class="break"></div>

        <h2 id="Calendar">Calendar</h2>
          This project started as a simple new tab page. I didn't like the way that
          chromes dark mode new tab looked, so I thought that I could do it better.
          This started out by having the search bar and the icons on the top right of
          the screen and it evolved from there.
          <br>
          <br>
          I began this project a couple weeks before Covid 19 caused everything to 
          go online.  I had the idea to incorporate my calendar into this new tab shortly
          before this had happened.  During this time I had been in a data structures
          class, so it was the perfect time to take on this type of project and it 
          is also the reason I chose to use scala.  I knew there
          were ways that I could download the ical file automatically, it was just a matter
          of parsing the file.  This code has undergone several ground up rebuilds and at this 
          moment I would say it is perfect for my use case.
          <br>
          <br>
          One of the main parts of this calendar were that I wanted to have the location
          displayed on the new tab page.  After this implementation and after 
          moveing to online, I realized that I could place my class meeting links in the 
          location field. After some regex to place the main site location as the name
          to be display, I know had a way to enter my lectures without having to search
          for a link for a specific class. To this day I have yet to miss an online lecture.
          <br>
          <br>
          When the semester ended I had the idea to make a full blown calendar using the same
          parsing code that I used for the new tab.  Now, making a simple calendary that was
          placed in a simple html grid would have been easy, but I wanted the ability to have
          user input.  I developed a way that I could click on a specific day and that days events
          would appear on the left of the calendar. I also included time indicators on each event.
          When an event is approaching it turns cyan and when it is current it turns red.  There are
          a few other options that can manipulate this feature, like it flashes red if exam is in the
          description and it is currently an active event.
          <br>
          <br>
          After the calendar was designed I purchased a raspberry pi that now sits in my room
          and displays my calendar all day with the help of some bash files to initiate parsing
          every thiry minutes and to power off the display at night.
          <br>
          <br>
          There was a lot of thought that went into the design and implementation of this project. 
          You can see the code for this project here:

        <h2 id="3dprint">3D Printing</h2>
          I really wanted to get more into 3D modeling, but didn't have
          a true reason to start.  After I got my 3D printer I have worked on 
          many small projects that have given me a basic understanding of how 
          modeling works.  Most of the modeling that I have done has been editing 
          a model that has already been made by someone else.  This has helped me 
          understand how other people take on the design process to tackle a project 
          of my own from scratch. 
          <br>
          <br>
          One design that I am particularly proud of is a laptop stand that I designed 
          to lift my laptop to a more ergonomic position.  While the design has some room
          for improvement, I have found it very useful and I use it everyday.

        <h2 id="GOL">Game of Life</h2>
        Originally I had this project as a homework assignment in my systems programming
        course.  I did this as a quick weekend project to see what could be done in just
        a few days.  There are many things about this project that I would do very 
        differently today, but I also learned a lot while working on this project.
        <br>
        <br>
        One of my major project requirements was that the used had to be able to click
        on any of the squares to test there own design on the algorithm.  This was important
        to me because the algorithm in itself is quite simple, I needed something to make
        this last a weekend. As I said before, if I did this project again I would do it very 
        differently.  The code if far from efficient, but I also didn't want to break the spirit
        of the original idea to see what could be done in a weekend and change it now.
        <br> 
        The code for this project can be found here:

        <h2 id="autohotkey">AutoHotKey</h2>
        One thing that I enjoy is creating programs that make programming and working
        on a computer in general more efficient.  I do that with autohotkey.  I have made
        several custom keybindings and guis to make my workflow easier.  Being a programmer
        there are many shortcuts that text editors have that the operating system does not.
        I use autohotkey to mimic some of these shortcuts.
        <br>
        <br>
        I also have some experience making guis with autohotkey.  One gui that I have made 
        is to display my music volume when it is increased or decreased.  This was necessary
        because originally I just make a keybinding to adjust my music volume, but I had no 
        visual reference for how high or low it was.  I designed the gui to look exactly like 
        the windows volume in the top left corner, but instead of a white block it has a green 
        one.

        <h2 id="vscode">VS code</h2>
        This isn't necessarily a project per se, but I beleive in efficient programming.
        An hour spent to adjust a text editor for effiecicy can be several hours saved
        in the future.  I have taken my time to get truly comfotable with vs code that 
        it is now my go to.  Sure, it isn't as light weight as emacs or vim, but it also 
        open much quiker than some other ide's that are available.

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        While a large part of my life is done working with computers
        I do have many things that I enjoy to do when I am not sitting 
        infront of my computer.

        <h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
        <h4>Skiing</h4>
        One of my favorite things to do in the winter is ski.  I have been skiing
        since I was about 4 years old and I have loved it ever since. I raced for 
        a little while when I was in middle and high school and even went to the state 
        championship a couple times.

        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Electric Skateboarding</h4>
        When it is too warm to ski, I enjoy electric skateboarding.  It gives me the 
        same adrenalin rush that skiing gives me, but I can do it when it is warm.  It
        is a lot of fun to some smooth pavement and carve around at full speed.

        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Cooking</h4>
        Something that calms me down after a stressful day is cooking.  At one point
        imposter syndrome was hitting me pretty hard and I was considering going to culinary
        school.


        <h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
        <h4>Technology</h4>
        I am really intersted in technology.  I love hearing about the newest best device
        that is just coming out and watching review about them. I enjoy talking to people
        about what is new and what is good and bad about the devices. This was one of the 
        big influences for getting into Computer Engineering
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>Cars</h4>
        Another thing that I am really interested in is cars.  While it may only ever
        be a dream of mine to be able to own a two hundred thousand dollar car, I still 
        really enjoy admiring them.
